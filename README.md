# news-z

This is a Simple and Basic web design Project.
This is about News-Z.
The file structure for this :
    News-z:
      img (here we store our images that will be used for the design)
      nav-page(here the navigation page will be included)
      script(here scripts are located for the index.html file. Like CSS file)
      index.html (this is our main site.)

Our initial target is to make this simple basic template design.
Then start adding the features into our web-page.
